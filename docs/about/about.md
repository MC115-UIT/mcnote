# Yah yah !!!

Hi, I’m Minh Cuong – fresh out of UIT and ready to code my way through life! By day, I’m a .NET software engineer, dabbling in the mysteries of data engineering, and by night, you might catch me on a long bus ride, treating it like meditation🧘‍♂️. With over 4 years of study and work experience on the bus, I've mastered the art of turning rush hour commutes into productive hours 😁

On weekends, I swap the screen for library books and occasionally hit the field for a game of football or a run. Coding pays the bills, but it’s all about balance, right?

Fun fact: I can sing... a little. Not winning any Grammys yet, but I’ll keep the karaoke bars entertained. Still waiting on a “Player 2” in life – applications are open 🫵 - by ChatGPT
