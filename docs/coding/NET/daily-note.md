# .NET 


**Blogs:**

- [The C# language design repo](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang), specifically the meeting notes for seeing what the language design team are working on and what their thoughts and opinions are.
    
- [The Morning Brew](https://blog.cwa.me.uk/), a handy blog
    
- [Discover .NET](https://discoverdot.net/blogs/), a grouping of various .NET related feeds, including blog posts and YouTube videos.
    
- [Microsoft DevBlogs](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/) is a meta-blog which includes a number of developer-centered blogs from Microsoft, including C#/.NET/VisualStudio. This also included [Raymond Chen's posts](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/author/oldnewthing). He doesn't blog much about C#/.NET, though his stories from working at Microsoft for several decades are fun reading material.
    

**YouTube channels:**

- [The official .NET channel](https://www.youtube.com/dotnet) posts often, and with a lot of varying content. Everything from introduction-level to livestreams with the C#/.NET design teams. Do note that this channel can get very spammy maybe once or twice a year, uploading a lot of conference VODs in the span of a few hours.
    
- [The official Visual Studio channel](https://www.youtube.com/@visualstudio) is another quite active channel, which features general content often relating to C#/.NET, including beginner friendly content.
    
- [Nick Chapsas](https://www.youtube.com/@nickchapsas) covers a wide spectrum of topics, including news as well as advanced topics. His videos tend to be reasonably short.
    
- [Tim Corey](https://www.youtube.com/@IAmTimCorey) makes a lot of beginner friendly long-form content, as well as cover various news and related topics (job search, interviewing, teamwork, etc.).
    
- [Patrick God](https://www.youtube.com/@PatrickGod) focuses mostly on Blazor, though he also covers other topics at times.
    
- [DevExpress](https://www.youtube.com/@DeveloperExpress/videos) also focuses a lot on Blazor.
    

**Podcasts:**

- [.NET Rocks](https://www.dotnetrocks.com/) is a weekly podcast that covers various topics each episode, usually with a guest who works in software development (often C#/.NET).
    
- [The Unhandled Exception Podcast](https://unhandledexceptionpodcast.com/) is mostly a chat/interview styled podcast, frequently with relation to C#/.NET.
    
- [The Modern .NET Show](https://dotnetcore.show/) is another chat/interview styled podcast centered around .NET.
    
- [Syntax.](https://syntax.fm/) is a general webdev/frontend focused podcast. They only rarely (if ever) cover C#/.NET, although I do find it useful as someone slowly getting into more general webdev work.
